# PSAP Control Center

A cluster management and reservation platform for the Performance and Scale for AI Platforms (PSAP) team. Provides observability into OpenShift cluster health, a reservation system with calendar views, and Hearth GPU discovery integration.

Deployment URLs are environment-specific. Discover the route for an OpenShift
deployment with:

```bash
oc get route psap-control-center -n <namespace> \
  -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
```

## Features

- **Cluster Registry** — Add and monitor clusters with live health, node topology visualization, OCP details, operators, and workloads.
- **Reservation System** — Full-cluster or partial GPU reservations with type-aware conflict detection. Color-coded calendar, cancellation tracking, and historical preservation when clusters are removed.
- **GPU Allocation & DRA** — Live GPU status via DRA (`resource.k8s.io`) with automatic fallback to legacy node capacity counting. Per-GPU-type breakdowns, ConfigMap-driven vendor abstraction.
- **Namespace Enforcement** — GPU reservations automatically provision isolated Kubernetes namespaces with `ResourceQuota` and optional DRA `ResourceClaimTemplate`. Namespaces are cleaned up on completion, cancellation, or deletion.
- **Calendar Views** — Weekly preview with overlapping reservation display (index-based opacity for distinguishing coexisting reservations), plus full month/week/day calendar.
- **Hearth Integration** — Discover GPU inventory from `FournosCluster` resources on a shared Hearth/Fournos management cluster.
- **Fournos Testing (development)** — Monitor live and archived test runs, submit schema-driven Forge jobs, schedule recurring work, and coordinate cluster locks from the Testing tab.
- **Cost Explorer & Billing** — Compare public, estimated, and actual infrastructure costs using cluster snapshots and uploaded IBM Cloud billing reports.
- **Slack Notifications** — Configure an incoming webhook for reservation notifications from the admin settings page.
- **Role-Based Access** — Public read access, signed-in reservation workflows, and administrator-only cluster, integration, billing, and cost management.
- **Structured Logging** — Consistent log format across backend and frontend, configurable via `LOG_LEVEL`.

```

The public Route terminates TLS at OpenShift and sends all traffic to Nginx.
Nginx serves the React application and proxies `/api` requests to FastAPI.
The backend stores application records in PostgreSQL and communicates with
managed clusters and the Hearth/Fournos management cluster through their
Kubernetes APIs.

Production delivery is pull-based: a push to `main` builds the frontend and
backend images in GitHub Actions and publishes `:latest` tags to Quay. An
in-cluster CronJob checks the image digests every two minutes and restarts only
the deployments whose digest changed. GitHub Actions does not require direct
access to the OpenShift API.

## Testing Tab (Development)

The development branch includes a Fournos-backed Testing workspace. It uses the
same management-cluster connection as Hearth, while the browser communicates
with Control Center's API.

- **Live Jobs** polls active `FournosJob` resources and opens a detail view with
  pipeline progress, pods, events, and streaming logs.
- **History** reads completed jobs archived in the Control Center database and
  supports project, cluster, status, date, sorting, and pagination controls.
- **Submit Job** discovers Forge projects and pipelines, renders project-owned
  `ui/submit.yaml` schemas, supports standard or matrix submissions, and can run
  immediately, defer a run, or create a recurring schedule. Custom non-Forge
  job definitions remain a planned capability.
- **Run grouping** associates jobs with reusable, product-neutral experiments,
  workload families, campaigns, or cohorts. Matrix jobs, recurring children,
  and reruns retain the selected grouping.
- **Schedules/Locks** manages recurring jobs and immediate or scheduled cluster
  locks, with cluster activity and child-run views.

Read-only Testing views are public. Submitting work, creating locks, and holding
calendar slots require a signed-in user. RHAIIS inference-server logs are
available only to the recorded job requester or an administrator. Cancelling or
rerunning jobs, deleting history, triggering or deleting schedules, and
releasing locks require an administrator.

### Importing existing Fournos history

Control Center's Kubernetes watcher captures FournosJobs going forward. To
backfill jobs and CPT submissions already archived by Fournos UI, run this
from the backend environment:

`python -m app.services.fournos_history_backfill`

Set `DATABASE_URL` to the Control Center database and
`FOURNOS_ARCHIVE_DATABASE_URL` to the Fournos UI database. Use a
read-only source database account with SELECT access to `jobs`, `cpt_runs`,
and `cpt_run_jobs`. The import is idempotent, preserves Control Center job
records, and retains CPT entries whose FournosJob could not be created. On
startup, the Control Center also backfills the indexed CPT group key for
existing rows; CPT list pages then load one page of groups and the detail view
loads only the selected group.

For ongoing capture, configure Control Center's `FOURNOS_NAMESPACE` to the
same namespace used by the Fournos UI deployment. The watcher performs an
initial sync, watches job changes, and periodically re-syncs the namespace.
Fournos UI CPT submissions include grouping metadata in their FournosJob
annotations so Control Center can track new runs from its own history store.
CPT read access uses the existing `fournos_jobs` and
`fournos_cpt_run_job_archive` records; Control Center computes and indexes a
stable `cpt_group_id` from each record's CPT dimensions. The startup migration
backfills that key for existing deployments.

New submissions use the Fournos operator's configured TTL unless
`FOURNOS_DEFAULT_JOB_TTL` is explicitly set. Priority defaults to `manual`,
including CPT submissions; the requester can select another configured
priority in the form.
