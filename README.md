# PSAP Control Center

A cluster management and reservation platform for the Performance and Scale for AI Platforms (PSAP) team. Provides observability into OpenShift cluster health, a reservation system with calendar views, and Hearth GPU discovery integration.

Deployment URLs are environment-specific. Discover the route for an OpenShift
deployment with:

```bash
oc get route psap-control-center -n <namespace> \
  -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
```

## Features

- **Cluster Registry** — Add and monitor clusters with live health, node topology visualization, OCP details, operators, and workloads.
- **Reservation System** — Full-cluster or partial GPU reservations with type-aware conflict detection. Color-coded calendar, cancellation tracking, and historical preservation when clusters are removed.
- **GPU Allocation & DRA** — Live GPU status via DRA (`resource.k8s.io`) with automatic fallback to legacy node capacity counting. Per-GPU-type breakdowns, ConfigMap-driven vendor abstraction.
- **Namespace Enforcement** — GPU reservations automatically provision isolated Kubernetes namespaces with `ResourceQuota` and optional DRA `ResourceClaimTemplate`. Namespaces are cleaned up on completion, cancellation, or deletion.
- **Calendar Views** — Weekly preview with overlapping reservation display (index-based opacity for distinguishing coexisting reservations), plus full month/week/day calendar.
- **Hearth Integration** — Discover GPU inventory from `FournosCluster` resources on a shared Hearth/Fournos management cluster.
- **Fournos Testing (development)** — Monitor live and archived test runs, submit schema-driven Forge jobs, schedule recurring work, and coordinate cluster locks from the Testing tab.
- **Cost Explorer & Billing** — Compare public, estimated, and actual infrastructure costs using cluster snapshots and uploaded IBM Cloud billing reports.
- **Slack Notifications** — Configure an incoming webhook for reservation notifications from the admin settings page.
- **Role-Based Access** — Public read access, signed-in reservation workflows, and administrator-only cluster, integration, billing, and cost management.
- **Structured Logging** — Consistent log format across backend and frontend, configurable via `LOG_LEVEL`.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query; served by Nginx |
| Backend | Python 3.11, FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, Kubernetes client |
| Database | SQLite for local development; PostgreSQL in production |
| Platform | OpenShift Routes, Services, Deployments, and persistent volumes |
| Delivery | GitHub Actions → Quay.io → in-cluster image-updater CronJob |
| Local runtime | Docker Compose or separate Vite/FastAPI processes |

```

The public Route terminates TLS at OpenShift and sends all traffic to Nginx.
Nginx serves the React application and proxies `/api` requests to FastAPI.
The backend stores application records in PostgreSQL and communicates with
managed clusters and the Hearth/Fournos management cluster through their
Kubernetes APIs.

Production delivery is pull-based: a push to `main` builds the frontend and
backend images in GitHub Actions and publishes `:latest` tags to Quay. An
in-cluster CronJob checks the image digests every two minutes and restarts only
the deployments whose digest changed. GitHub Actions does not require direct
access to the OpenShift API.

## Testing Tab (Development)

The development branch includes a Fournos-backed Testing workspace. It uses the
same management-cluster connection as Hearth, while the browser communicates
with Control Center's API.

- **Live Jobs** polls active `FournosJob` resources and opens a detail view with
  pipeline progress, pods, events, and streaming logs.
- **History** reads completed jobs archived in the Control Center database and
  supports project, cluster, status, date, sorting, and pagination controls.
- **Submit Job** discovers Forge projects and pipelines, renders project-owned
  `ui/submit.yaml` schemas, supports standard or matrix submissions, and can run
  immediately, defer a run, or create a recurring schedule. Custom non-Forge
  job definitions remain a planned capability.
- **Schedules/Locks** manages recurring jobs and immediate or scheduled cluster
  locks, with cluster activity and child-run views.

Read-only Testing views are public. Submitting work, creating locks, and holding
calendar slots require a signed-in user. Cancelling or rerunning jobs, deleting
history, triggering or deleting schedules, and releasing locks require an
administrator.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openshift-psap/psap-control-center.git
cd psap-control-center
cp .env.example .env    # Review configuration as needed
docker compose up --build -d
```

- UI: http://localhost:3000

### Local Development

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (Vite proxies /api to :8000)
