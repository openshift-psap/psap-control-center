"""Pydantic models for the Forge project UI schema contract.

Any Forge project can publish a declarative ``projects/<name>/ui/submit.yaml``
file in the Forge repo describing what fields the Control Center should render
on its submit form, and which submission key each field's value maps to. This
lets the Control Center render a fully dynamic form for *any* project from one
shared fetch/render pipeline, instead of hand-rolling a bespoke form per
project (as was previously done for RHAIIS alone).

See docs/ui-schema-spec.md for the full authoring guide.
